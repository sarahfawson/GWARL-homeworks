    "### OBSERVATIONS:\n",
    "* Charter schools showed significantly higher grades and passing rates in both subjects than district schools. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school. \n",
    "\n",
    "* As a whole, schools with higher budgets did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending per student actually underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets to allocate to their students.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%). We do not know if this corresponds to fewer students led by each teacher or not.\n",
